# Code Interpreter with AWS ECS

A lightweight **LLM execution pipeline** built entirely on **AWS managed services**.  
User prompts are sent through an API endpoint, processed serverlessly, and executed inside a scalable ECS Fargate container.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Accept user prompts via **API Gateway**
- Orchestrate execution with **AWS Lambda**
- Run arbitrary code or LLM-based tasks on **ECS Fargate**
- Query and reason over **Amazon Redshift** tables using an LLM deployed on **Amazon Bedrock**
- Any outputs produced by the agent is saved in **s3** (see `/results`)

The LLM understands the database schema and can:
- Answer analytical questions about the data
- Generate SQL queries
- Build and execute machine learning models from the tables

---

## Data Sources

There are two tables stored in **Amazon Redshift** (see `/input`):

- **`users`**
- **`interactions`**

The LLM agent is aware of these schemas and can reason over them directly.

## Components

### API Gateway
- **Type:** HTTP API
- **Endpoint:** `POST /prompt`
- **Format:** JSON

#### Example Request
```
api_gateway_url = "https://<your-API-here>/default/lambda-create-ppt"

prompt = '''
    Make a machine learning model from 'interaction' table. Use 'purchase' column for the target variable.
    '''

payload = {"prompt": prompt}
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
response = requests.post(api_gateway_url, json=payload, headers=headers, )  #auth=auth,)
```

### AWS Lambda
Handler function that orchestrates the execution pipeline and manages ECS task invocation.

### ECS Fargate
Containerized execution environment providing isolated, scalable compute for code interpretation and LLM operations.

### Amazon Bedrock
Hosts the LLM agent with awareness of the Redshift schema, enabling intelligent query generation and data analysis.
